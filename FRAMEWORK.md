# Antifragile-Progress Framework

A lightweight decision guardrail to **sharpen ideas** and **unlock momentum**.  
Use it before investing in a feature, product, experiment, process, or initiative.

---

## Principles
- **Solve today’s pains.** Avoid hypotheticals.  
- **Momentum over complexity.** Small wins beat perfect plans.  
- **Lean test first.** Evidence before architecture.  
- **Via negativa.** Subtract the unnecessary to make progress antifragile.  
- **Optionality.** Sometimes planting a small seed today unlocks future antifragile rewards.

## The 5 Checks

### 1) Clarity (Pain)
- What **current** pain does this solve? Who feels it?  
- ✅ Proceed if the pain is present and blocking.  
- ❌ Kill if it’s hypothetical only.  

### 2) Momentum
- If you abandon this tomorrow, what loses progress?  
- ✅ Proceed if real momentum is at risk.  
- ❌ Kill if nothing slows down.  

### 3) Scope & Audience
- Who benefits now? (Personal / Team / Division / Company / World)  
- Why should they care **this week**?  
- ✅ Proceed if clear and immediate.  
- ❌ Simplify or Pivot if unclear or too broad.  

### 4) Lean Test
- What is the **one-day test** that proves adoption/impact?  
- ✅ Proceed only with a test runnable in hours, not weeks.  
- ❌ Simplify if it requires overbuilding.  

### 5) Antifragile Future Momentum (Seed)
- Could a **small, cheap action today** plant a seed that grows stronger under stress and benefits the future?  
- ✅ Proceed if cost is low and payoff compounds under uncertainty.  
- ❌ Kill if it locks in fragility (big cost, speculative gain).

## Decision Outcomes

- **Proceed Lean**: Commit to the one-day test, learn, iterate.  
- **Simplify**: Reduce scope until the test fits one day.  
- **Pivot**: Redirect energy to a sharper, more antifragile alternative.  
- **Seed**: Plant a low-cost seed today for future antifragile rewards.  
- **Kill**: Rare, only when no real pain, no pivot, and no worthwhile seed exist.

## Example Walkthrough

**Idea:** Build an automated reporting dashboard.  

- **Clarity:** What’s painful in the current report today? Who needs it this week?  
- **Momentum:** If stopped, who slows down?  
- **Scope:** Which 3 people benefit now?  
- **Lean Test:** Send a one-page manual report first. Measure replies.  
- **Seed:** Is there a cheap action that sets us up for stronger future reporting?  

**Decision:** *Pivot* → Drop the full dashboard idea, but *Simplify* by sending a manual report today. If people use it twice, consider a minimal automation.

## Changelog

- **v0.1 (beginning)**: 4 Checks (Clarity, Momentum, Scope, Lean Test). Outcomes: Proceed Lean, Simplify, Park, Kill.  
- **v0.2 (iteration)**: Added Antifragile Seed as a 5th Check (rare exception for future momentum).  
- **v1.0 (current)**: Reframed outcomes:  
  - *Park* replaced with **Pivot** (redirect energy instead of backlog graveyard).  
  - *Seed* formalized as its own outcome, not just an exception.  
  - Outcomes are now all verbs: Proceed Lean, Simplify, Pivot, Seed, Kill.
